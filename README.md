So far just a work in progress.

This application is aiming to become an application which produces tables and graphs from data stored in a database. 

The core functionality of the application lies in the "public blueprint"

Each add on features is seperated in its own designated blueprint. So far the following have been made:

- Engine - Collects and displays data from Zepto Sensors
- Weather - Collects displays data from forecastio
- Nordpool - Pulls energy data from nordpool
